# Common programming principles

## Variables & Mutability

- Use the keyword `let = 5;` to create a new variable.
- Variables are immutable by default. 
- If you wanna make a variable mutable add the keyword `let mut x = 5;`

## Constants

- Use the keyword `const` to declare a constant
- A constant aren't just immutable by default, they're always immutable.

## Shadowing

- Is creating a new variable.

## Scope

- To declare a scope use the `{}` and right all the code in the.
